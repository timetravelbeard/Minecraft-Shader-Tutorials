These Minecraft Shader Tutorials are also available at the following links, and probably have newer versions and more tutorials there:

Patreon (free):
	https://www.patreon.com/posts/105855874?collection=1235733
		
Modrinth: 
	https://modrinth.com/shader/make-your-own-shaders

I honestly think browsing the files is a lot more intuitive on those other platforms because they are shown in order on both, and Modrinth has descriptions and video links in each version's changelog.
	
The video walkthroughs are here:
