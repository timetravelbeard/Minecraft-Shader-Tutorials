These Minecraft Shader Tutorials are also available at the following links, and probably have newer versions and more tutorials there:

Patreon (free):

Modrinth: 
	https://modrinth.com/shader/make-your-own-shaders

I think browsing the files is a lot more intuitive on those platforms because each version has a description & they are shown in order.
	
The video walkthroughs are here:
